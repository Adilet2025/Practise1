Python is interesting for me because it is easy to start. 
The code looks clean and simple. 
I can write a program and see the result quickly. 
Python helps me learn logic step by step. I use it to solve small math tasks. 
I can also work with numbers and lists. 
I like that Python has many useful libraries. With Python, I can create small projects for study. 
It is also good for future jobs. When I make a mistake, I learn from it and try again. 
I feel progress after each lesson. That is why I want to learn Python more.
